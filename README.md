## Overview
This project uses a dataset that includes information about renewable energy contributions in different countries over time. The aim is to build a predictive model using linear regression to forecast future renewable energy values.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:
- **LOCATION**: Country code
- **INDICATOR**: Energy type
- **SUBJECT**: Subject category
- **MEASURE**: Measurement unit
- **FREQUENCY**: Data frequency
- **TIME**: Year
- **Value**: Energy value in KTOE
- **Flag Codes**: Additional flags (not used in the model)

Here is a small part of the CSV:
```plaintext
"LOCATION","INDICATOR","SUBJECT","MEASURE","FREQUENCY","TIME","Value","Flag Codes"
"AUS","RENEWABLE","TOT","KTOE","A","1960",4436.932,
"AUS","RENEWABLE","TOT","KTOE","A","1961",4490.51,
"AUS","RENEWABLE","TOT","KTOE","A","1962",4407.097,
```

## Understanding KTOE
- **KTOE**: Kilotonnes of oil equivalent. It is a unit of energy that helps compare different forms of energy based on their energy content.
  - **1 TOE**: 1 tonne of oil equivalent is the amount of energy released by burning one tonne of crude oil, approximately 42 gigajoules.
  - **1 KTOE**: Kilotonnes of oil equivalent (1 KTOE = 1,000 tonnes of oil equivalent).

## Primary Energy Supply
- **Primary Energy**: The total energy available from natural resources before any transformation to other forms of energy like electricity or refined fuels.
- **Primary Energy Supply**: The total amount of primary energy a country or region has available for use, including energy production plus imports, minus exports, and changes in stock.

## Model Description
The model uses a linear regression algorithm to predict the renewable energy values. It preprocesses the data using `SimpleImputer` for missing values and `OneHotEncoder` for categorical features. PCA is used for dimensionality reduction and visualization.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Prince07746/renewable-energy-prediction.git
   cd renewable-energy-prediction
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. clone the repository
2. Navigate into the repository `cd Renewable_Energy_Predictions`
3. Ensure the dataset `renewable_energy.csv` is in the project directory.
4. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python renewabePrediction.py
   ```
5. The script will load the data, preprocess it, train a linear regression model, and make predictions.

## Results
The script will output the following:
- **Prediction**: Predicted values for the test set.
- **Train score**: R² score of the model on the training set.
- **Test score**: R² score of the model on the test set.
- **Plots**: Scatter plot of the actual vs. predicted values over time, and PCA plot of the training data.
